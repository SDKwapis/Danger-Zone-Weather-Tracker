# Danger-Zone-Weather-Tracker

A basic weather checker app that displays the current forecast and the 5-day forecast for a specific city when searched.

## Usage

In the 'Search For A City' text entry field type in your local city name (or any of city of your choosing). The current weather conditions
for that city will then display to the right and the 5-day forecast will display below that. Previously searched cities will be displayed as
clickable buttons underneath the 'search' button so you can easily revisit the weather in those areas.
